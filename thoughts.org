SOME THOUGHTS

* Conti little project
  After a meeting with Sestini, the following should be interesting to
  include in my document:
  - explain the symmetry and multiaffinity of the Blossing
  - ask for ``Interactive curves and surfaces'' by Rockwood volume
  - search for ``A tutorial introduction to blossoming'' by Goldman and deRose
